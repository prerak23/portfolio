I defended my PhD in October 2023 under the supervision of Emmanuel Vincent and Antoine Deleforge at INRIA, Nancy. The main focus of this PhD was to built Machine learning systems applied to audio signals in order to estimate acoustic room parameters and sound source localization. This research further branched out to niche topics such as Acoustics, Signal Processing, Bayesien Inference and Deep Neural Network. Prior to this, i completed my Masters in Natural Language Processing from Universit√© de Lorraine, Nancy, this masters programe was cumulated with a 6 month Research Internship at Orange Labs, Rennes, in this brief time we manage to get a acceptence for our reserach paper submitted to WASPPA 2021. So by profession i am researcher. On a daily basis, i understand and build systems to analyze audio, speech and text using machine learning techinques.","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/prerak23","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/prerak-aar/"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
